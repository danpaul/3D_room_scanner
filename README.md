There are 2 programs in this project. The first is an Arduiono program which scans the room and sends data to the second Processing program via the serial port. The processing program parses the data and constructs a 3D model of the room. Using the Ping distance detector, some rounding of edges occurs.
	To use the 3D scanner, it is necessary to connect the power supplies and the USB cable to your PC.  The scanner is initialized when the processing program is run.  Simply run the processing program and wait for the scanner to complete.  Once complete, the processing program will present a 3D model of the room.  Various parameters can be specified in the macro and global variable definitions of the Arduino and Processing programs.  These parameters define the range to scan as well as the speed at which to scan.  Slower speeds result in a more detailed scan.  See the comments of the Arduino macros for further detail on these specifications.  
	The only code that needs to be manually synchronized between the Arduino and Processing programs are the VERTICAL_DEGREE_MIN, VERTUICAL_DEGREE_MAX and VERTICAL_DEGREE_INCREMENT specifications which define the minimum and maximum vertical degrees and the number of degrees to increment between scans.  All other specifications can be specified in the Arduino program alone.
